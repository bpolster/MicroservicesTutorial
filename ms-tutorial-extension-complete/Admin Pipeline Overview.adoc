==== Overview

The following diagram is a high level diagram that depicts the Metadata "Pipeline"
in which it is responsible for rendering navigation, requesting view metadata,
requesting user allowed scopes for views, requesting access tokens, rendering the view,
and finally, requesting CRUD on the domain service.

1. the metadata service receives its initial set of metadata from a variety of sources
(metadata providers)

2. Each Broadleaf Microservice has a provider out-of-box, like catalog and pricing, which provide
the metadata needed for those services

3. the metadata from these providers is then stored in the metadata service

4. when the client requests metadata for a view from the REST API, the metadata is processed by
an augmentation layer before being returned to the client

[TIP]
====
this augmentation layer is another useful extension point for making modification to the metadata
before itâ€™s returned to the client

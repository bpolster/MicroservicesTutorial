=== Overview
Broadleaf leverages https://spring.io/projects/spring-data[Spring Data] for entity persistence.
Spring Data supports polymorphism as part of the data interaction, which facilitates standard
Java OOP extension of out-of-the-box Broadleaf repository domain classes.
Fields may be added in extensions to support additional business
requirements. Also, mutator methods can be overridden for additional customization.

Queries through existing Broadleaf repositories should return the more derived repository domain
as appropriate. As well, creation of entity state should be accurate to the more derived type.
